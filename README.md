# Zepto-Analysis-Using-SQL

This project uses SQL to analyze a Zepto-style grocery dataset with the goal of understanding pricing, discounts, stock availability, and inventory distribution. Instead of visualizations or dashboards, the focus is on writing clean SQL queries that answer practical business questions.

# Dataset

The dataset (Zepto CSV.csv) contains product-level information typically found in quick-commerce platforms, including:

- Product name and category
- MRP and discount percentage
- Discounted selling price
- Available stock quantity
- Product weight
- Out-of-stock indicator

The data represents how products are priced, stocked, and categorized at scale.


# What This Project Analyzes

- Using SQL, this project explores:
- Products and categories with the highest discounts
- Stock availability and out-of-stock items
- Inventory distribution across product categories
- Weight-based segmentation of products
- Total inventory weight based on available stock

Each query is designed to reflect real decision-making scenarios rather than academic examples.

# SQL Skills Demonstrated

- This project showcases practical SQL skills, including:
- Table creation and data validation
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Conditional logic using CASE WHEN
- Aggregations using SUM, AVG, and COUNT
- Grouping and sorting for insights
- Writing readable and structured queries

No frameworks, no shortcuts just SQL.
